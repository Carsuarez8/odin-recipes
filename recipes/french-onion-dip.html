    <h3 class="topic"> About French Onion dip</h3>
    
    <p>The perfect play between flavor and texture, this duo-dip has something for everybody to love. 
    The low and slow caramelization deepens the flavor of the onions, giving the dip an unmistakable made-from-scratch taste. 
    Speckled with crunchy pickles, fresh dill, and golden onions, this cool and creamy dip has a hint of salty, sweet, and tangy in every bite. 
    Best paired with ridge-cut potato chips or pretzels.</p>
